# ETAF Bili manual

## Discover and search

Run `M-x etaf-bili-open`. The popular feed loads asynchronously into a cover
card gallery. Click the channel tabs or press `1`/`2` for popular videos and
the ranking. `/` starts editing the rounded search field in the page; text,
Chinese input, undo and selection use the catalog's native editing session.
Return submits. Escape keeps the draft without running a search.

Each card shows a proportionally fitted cover, duration, title, creator, view
count and publication date. Wide windows show more columns; shorter windows
use a smaller cover area. The main grid has a maximum reading width rather
than stretching every card across the frame. The minimum usable content area
is 64 columns by 28 lines. Below it the interface clips deliberately.

The wheel or trackpad scrolls continuously through the loaded results; there
are no page controls. Arrow keys move through the grid and `n`/`p` move
sequentially, scrolling the selected card into view when necessary.
`j`/`k` are sequential shortcuts only under the default direction scheme;
with ETAF's Vim direction scheme they retain direction semantics.

The details action (`i`) opens a Drawer. Escape closes it and restores focus.
The metadata does not occupy a permanently empty sidebar. `?` lists the
actual declared bindings and `M-g` selects the search, channel or video region.

## Loading and motion

The first request shows geometry-matched Skeleton cards. A scoped frame
animation marks pending work; selecting another card animates its accent
fill for 160 ms. Neither waits before sending a request. Animations belong
to Component scopes and stop when the component disappears or the app closes.
Set `etaf-animation-enabled` to nil for reduced motion.

A failed request shows an Alert and retry action; an empty successful search
shows an Empty component, not the previous results. Late list or playback
responses cannot replace a newer request. Closing the buffer makes outstanding
callbacks inert and releases its cover transfers and animation scopes.

Only visible card rows and a small overscan window are mounted and request
covers, with at most three concurrent transfers. The image CDN download is capped at 2 MiB per file and atomically
installed under `etaf-bili-state-directory/covers/`. Failed images show a
placeholder without blocking video playback. Native image dimensions are read
once outside rendering. Each cover is contained at its original aspect ratio;
partial image rows use the Image Host's inset instead of distorting the image.

## Playback

Press Return on a card or activate its play button. The service first resolves
video metadata and then a progressive stream, with the Referer and User-Agent
headers required by the CDN. The catalog MediaViewer opens in the same buffer.
Space plays/pauses, arrows seek, `m` toggles sound, `.` cycles speed, and `n`/`p`
resolve the adjacent video. Escape or `q` closes the viewer, not the library.

The server controls availability, quality and URL expiry. This client does not
implement login, account libraries, comments, danmaku or paid-content access.
Reopen playback to resolve an expired stream. No permanent stream URL is saved.

## Integration

The root Commentary documents session and client interfaces. A client may be a
function accepting `(REQUEST CALLBACK)`, returning `(:ok DATA)` or
`(:error MESSAGE :hint HINT)` through the callback. Tests use that injection
point without touching the network. A `:cover` request returns a local image
path; a fake client may return an error to exercise placeholders.

Session actions are asynchronous; consume a result in its callback rather
than assuming a load has completed in the next form:

```elisp
(let ((client (etaf-bili-make-client)))
  (etaf-bili-client-call
   client '(:op :search :keyword "Emacs 配置")
   (lambda (reply)
     (message "%s" (if (plist-member reply :ok)
                       (format "%d results" (length (plist-get reply :ok)))
                     (plist-get reply :error))))))
```

`etaf-bili-session-state` returns detached data for a session. Search signing
uses the server's WBI keys and URI-component encoding; the session's cookie
jar is maintained under `etaf-bili-state-directory`. Neither cookies nor
signed stream URLs belong in a repository or diagnostic transcript.

## GUI verification

Use a dedicated graphical Emacs with the full user configuration. Keep the
native title bar and foreground focus untouched. After compiling the package,
load ETAF's maintained verification engine and this app's scenario adapter:

```elisp
(load "/path/to/etaf/scripts/emacs-gui-verifier.el")
(load "/path/to/etaf-bili/scripts/etaf-bili-gui-scenarios.el")
(etaf-bili-gui-run "/tmp/bili-gui-evidence")
```

The adapter drives actual catalog targets and native text input, verifies cover
aspect ratios, drives a wheel event and keyboard reveal, searches and ranks
real videos, opens and closes details, and
captures both themes at ordinary, compact, wide and short sizes. Review the
captures separately from the assertions. Playback and pointer feedback need
their real-data pass too; batch acceptance does not certify those properties.

The workspace performance driver accepts
`--scenario-file etaf-apps/etaf-bili/benchmarks/performance-scenarios.el
--scenario bili.appearance --load-path etaf-apps/etaf-bili` with `--mode batch`
or `--mode gui --server NAME`. Use `--scenario bili.scroll` for continuous
scrolling across virtual rows in a hundred-video offline library. Keep sources
quiet during measurement and use
three independent sets for a final latency claim.
